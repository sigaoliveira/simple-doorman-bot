# simple-doorman-bot

My first attempt to create a simple Discord bot based on some open sources projects available.
At this point, it is completely based on the following project:
https://gist.github.com/eslachance/3349734a98d30011bb202f47342601d3

My goal is to learn from this project code and be able to introduce some features, specially database related.
